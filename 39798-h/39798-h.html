<br />Out on the hills the scarlet maples shone—
<br />The glad, first herald of triumphant dawn.
<br />A robin's song fell through the silence—clear
<br />As long ago it rang when June was here.
<br />Then, suddenly, a few grey clouds were drawn
<br />Across the sky; and all the song was gone,
<br />And all the gold was quick to disappear,
<br />That day the sun seemed loth to come again;
<br />And all day long the low wind spoke of rain,
<br />Far off, beyond the hills; and moaned, like one
<br />Wounded, among the pines: as though the Earth,
<br />Knowing some giant grief had come to birth,
<br />Had wearied of the Summer and the Sun.</span></p>

<br />Slowly the leaves fell from the elms, and lay
<br />Along the roadside; and the wind's strange way
<br />Was their way, when they heard the wind's far call.
<br />The crimson vines that clung along the wall
<br />Grew thin as snow that lives on into May;
<br />Grey dawn, grey noon,—all things and hours were grey,
<br />When quietly the darkness covered all.
<br />And while no sunset flamed across the west,
<br />And no great moon rose where the hills were low,
<br />The day passed out as if it had not been:
<br />And so it seemed the year sank to its rest,
<br />Remembering naught, desiring naught,—as though
<br />Early in Spring its young leaves were not green.</span></p>

<br />A day came when the frail year paused and said:
<br />"Behold! a little while and I am dead;
<br />Wilt thou not choose, of all the old dreams, one?"
<br />Then dwelt I in a garden, where the sun
<br />Shone always, and the roses all were red;
<br />Far off, the great sea slept, and overhead,
<br />Among the robins, matins had begun.
<br />And I knew not at all it was a dream
<br />Only, and that the year was near its close;
<br />Garden and sunshine, robin-song and rose,
<br />The half-heard murmur and the distant gleam
<br />Of all the unvext sea, a little space
<br />Were as a mist above the Autumn's face.</span></p>

<br />I dwelt (it seemed) to watch a pageant pass,—
<br />Great Kings, their armour strong with iron and brass,
<br />Young Queens, with yellow hair bound wonderfully.
<br />For love's sake, and because of love's decree,
<br />Most went, I knew; and so the flowers and grass
<br />Knew my steps also: yet I wept Alas,
<br />Deeming the garden surely lost to me.
<br />But as the days went over, and still our feet
<br />Trod the warm, even places, I knew well
<br />(For I, as they, followed the close-heard beat
<br />Of Love's wide wings who was her sentinel)
<br />That here had Beauty built her citadel
<br />And only we should reach her mercy-seat.</span></p>

all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free
access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works
in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
